Robotic Controller Design Using Genetic Algorithm

Problem Statement :

Genetic Algorithm has wide use in robotics and AI to perform complex tasks with one algorithm removing need of manually coding for every function. In this problem we will apply genetic algorithm to design robot controller to perform actions (Movement) based on the inputs (Sensor), so the robot can navigate itself without need of directing it in an unknown environment. For example if we have a robot with N sensors to detect anomalies in physical space we need program the robot to take decisions based on 2^N action sequence base is 2 here since output of the sensor is 0 or 1. It is tedious to manually code the response for 2^N action sequence. So our objective is to use genetic algorithm to design robotic controller to respond to any given input action. In this project we will use maze structure as a testing environment for the designed robot.

In our problem, we are dealing with a robot controller which uses its sensors to navigate its way from the maze and avoid the obstacles. Depending on the Robots decision the robot will initiate the four actions which are it either turns left, turns right,  go straight or does nothing with the help of  sensors. Our task is to design the robot controller so that it can navgate itself.
